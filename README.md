# Payroll-Management-System-Using-C-
Welcome to the C# Payroll Management System! This project contains code compatible with Visual Studio 2013 and .NET Framework 4.5.7 and a SQL 2014 database. I'd appreciate it if you could dive into this project to learn more about payroll management and how to integrate databases with C# applications.
This payroll management system includes functionality to add, delete, and update employee and salary data. It can fetch records from the database upon form load and after updates to the database, ensuring you always have the most current information at your fingertips.
One key feature is the ability to print records from the database as a PDF or paper print, making it easy to generate and share reports.
Everyone can download and use it.
